# Smart meter project

Blockchain is widely researched and practiced today because of its immutability and enhanced security. 

The idea of this project is to leverage blockchain technology to simplify and secure household energy bills payment. 

This project consists of four parts: a smart meter that reflects the energy usage of a household, a single board computer (SOC) programmed with a smart contract to read the smart meter and generate the bill then attach the bill to the blockchain, a blockchain ledger called Ethereum, and a user interface to display reading records and payments. 

The smart contract was written by Solidity language. The communication between SOC and Ethereum is built by Web3.js. The user interface is implemented as a website by React.js.

The SOC I used is ```Beaglebone```:

The User-interface is implemented by website:
